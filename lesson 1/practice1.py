# Ex:
variable = 123 # str

variable1 = "test"                              # [Answer here]
variable2 = 12345                               # [Answer here]
variable3 = 123.45                              # [Answer here]
variable4 = "123"                               # [Answer here]
variable5 = "123.45"                            # [Answer here]
variable6 = True                                # [Answer here]
variable7 = "False"                             # [Answer here]
variable8 = [123.32, 124, 53, "Test", 'random'] # [Answer here]
variable9 = (123, 12, 1, 32.2, "Pie", "Static") # [Answer here]
